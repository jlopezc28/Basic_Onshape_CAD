## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

This is how you will write image code for INTERNALLY STORED images on your repo.   just FYI.

## Reflection



This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
In this assignment we are making a square that's 120 x 120 mm
### Evidence

I was strugging to finish it at first until i realized there was a video for the tutorial on how to do it https://cvilleschools.instructure.com/courses/31063/assignments/278967?module_item_id=874023
The thing i was really struggling to add construction lines( on keyboard is Q)

## Fork

### Description
this piece is a 80 mm with two filleted rectangles 
### Evidence
[The Fork in OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/675f762231edfebe53832c22)

### Reflection
This one took me a while but wasn't too difficult to complete. I personaly really like this piece since it's the first one we used the fillet in

---



## Tire

### Description
This piece is a 20 mm rectangle that is then revolved on the x axis of the sketch to make the circle
### Evidence
[The Tire in OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/d135273df4c28b5a158f01c0)

### Reflection
The shape on this one really through me off I really thought we were going to extrude a circle, But in reality

---



## Wheel

### Description
this piece is made up of 3 rectangles that are revolvrd just like with the tire 
### Evidence
[The wheel in OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/6850a7beb8a016f513f19919)
### Image

### Reflection
This one is probably the one that took me the longest since there were so many steps to take, but the bearing that is with the wheel was really .

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
This piece is a 2 circles one is 6 mm and theoter is 10mm, which is then extruded into a cylander. The collar then is a circle that wraps around the axle
### Evidence

### Reflection
the axle itself was simple and so was the axle, but that whole on the axle. boyy did that take me a while. turns out i needed to hold the origin on my circle instead of the circle itself

---



## Subassembly

### Description
Here you will be merging the wheel with the tire, the axle, and two bearings
### Evidence
[The subassembly in OnShape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/878b104096b3009b51785d59)

### Reflection
I was already used to merging with other cad websites so this was pretty easy

---



## Final Assembly

### Description
IN this assignment we are adding all our previous parts and the subassembly to finish a working caster
### Evidence

### Image

### Reflection
This build was really stessing me out do to the fact that the fork was the one moving with the animation, but that was because instead of clicking the fork first you click the wheel first and since the fork is already mated it won't move

---



## CollaborationChallenge
### Description
In this assignment we are to make a vaccum pump with each teamate making their parts and assembling the final thing
### Evidence

### Image
<img src="https://github.com/jlopezc28/Basic_Onshape_CAD/blob/master/images/colabchallenge.png?raw=true" width="200">

### Reflection
The build wasn't too difficult since we all agreed on the measuremnets and helped eachother if we didn't know what to do. For the plunger to move was the most difficult thing in my case since I didn't know how to assign the limits. After a while of my teamate helping me get it to work in our favor we snapped everything perfectly.
