## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

I was strugging to finish it at first until i realized there was a video for the tutorial on how to do it.The thing i was really struggling to add construction lines

# This is where all my progress is reported


The mount is done, I was strugging to finish it at first until i realized there was a video for the tutorial on how to do it.
heres the link to the mount https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/79a35908bc47778eac673a90

This one took me a while but wasn't too difficult to complete
the link to the fork https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/675f762231edfebe53832c22

The tire was pretty easy, the shape threw me off at first but regardless the video helped explain
That's the link to my tire https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/d135273df4c28b5a158f01c0

The wheel came with a lot of steps, some of them like making the holes made me struggle. adding the bearing was simple though
the link for the wheel and bearing https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/6850a7beb8a016f513f19919

the axle it self was simple and so was the axle, but that whole on the axle. boyy did that take me a while. turns out i needed to hold the origin on my circle instead of the circle itself
this is the link for the axle and caster https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/6c483a6c91f64788cc39a31f
