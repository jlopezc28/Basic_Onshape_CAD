# This is where all my progress is reported


The mount is done, I was strugging to finish it at first until i realized there was a video for the tutorial on how to do it.
heres the link to the mount https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/79a35908bc47778eac673a90

This one took me a while but wasn't too difficult to complete

The tire was pretty easy, the shape threw me off at first but regardless the video helped explain
That's the link to my tire https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/d135273df4c28b5a158f01c0

The wheel came with a lot of steps, some of them like making the holes made me struggle. adding the bearing was simple though

the axle it self was simple and so was the axle, but that whole on the axle. boyy did that take me a while. turns out i needed to hold the origin on my circle instead of the circle itself
this is the link for the axle and caster https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/85b4317d4da0fd0fa324b129/w/e220e57b56170a53aa2f0e31/e/6c483a6c91f64788cc39a31f
